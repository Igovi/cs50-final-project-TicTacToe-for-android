# cs50-final-project-TicTacToe-for-android
My final project for cs50 consist in a android TicTacToe application which is made up by an [3][3] matriz of buttons.
 The app works by listening to buttons click and changing the button text value to "X" or "O",
 after each click the app go through the matrix to check if theres was a win condition,
 if there is a win the player who won get +1 points and the game restarts If the roundCount pass from 9
 it means that theres is no more buttons to click so the app declare draw.
