# cs50-final-project-TicTacToe-for-android
My final project for cs50 consist in a android TicTacToe application which is made up by an [3][3] matrix of buttons.
 I thought making this app so that when people gather with friends they can play TicTacToe without wasting any papers ,
 just getting the app on your phone. The app works by listening to buttons click and changing the button text value to "X" or "O",
 after each click the app go through the matrix to check if theres was a win condition,
 if there is a win the player who won get +1 points and the game restarts If the roundCount pass from 9
 it means that theres is no more buttons to click so the app declare draw.
